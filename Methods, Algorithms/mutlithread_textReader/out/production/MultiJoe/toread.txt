Airships could offer a much cleaner and quieter alternative for some aspects of the aviation market. In a former airship factory, a new generation are taking shape.

Sergey Brin turned internet search into one of the world’s most valuable businesses more than two decades ago. Now he intends to improve a technology which had its heyday long before he was born.

Brin and his team of engineers' plan is to do this by reinventing a much older, if improved technology. A new generation of airships – the lighter-than-air craft that don't need conventional airports – will be built in a corner of Ohio which played a unique part in the history of aviation. What's more, if built they will be housed in one of America's most iconic structures, the Goodyear Airdock in Akron.

Airships could help speed up the delivery of aid in disaster zones, carry air cargo much more cheaply than air freighters, and cut aviation emissions. However, similar projects in the past have struggled to overcome the complex engineering challenges involved, and have either run out of money, or left potential customers disillusioned.

"Flying an airship is unlike flying any other aircraft because it’s lighter than air and floats, instead of sinks, when you put the power at idle," says Andrea Deyling, a pilot and director of airship operations of Brin’s airship company, LTA Research. "There’s also a sense of wonder people have when they see a lighter-than-air vehicle flying overhead. LTA Research is building a unique airship and I can't wait to get into the actual aircraft and fly it."

In the first half of the 20th Century, Akron in Ohio, was known as the "rubber capital of the world" because it was home to great American tyre manufacturers such as one time arch-rivals Goodyear and Firestone, and it soon became a centre of airship development thanks to the connections between the two industries.

Even though these industries have since declined, their legacy remains. Around 14 miles (22km) south of the city, Goodyear built an airship base at Wingfoot Lake in 1917 that, over 100 years later, still constructs and maintains the company's blimp fleet. This makes it the oldest airship facility in the world, and one of the oldest active aircraft bases.

Similarly, Akron University grew on the back of the tyre and airship manufacturing industry, and its College of Engineering and Polymer Science is one of the top faculties of its kind in the United States. The cluster of businesses that have grown up around it has even led to the area’s being labelled "Polymer Valley".

The Goodyear-Zeppelin Airdock, to use its original name, was designed in a wind tunnel, looked like it belonged in Flash Gordon, and when was built in 1929, it was the largest building in the world without interior supports. Incredibly the $2.2m structure, equivalent to around $30m (£25m) today took only seven months to build.

It is not possible to see the Airdock from the centre of Akron. Instead, you need to drive out of the city, past the university and on to the freeway. Then this giant black building appears in front of you, like a buried half-cylinder with two scallop shells at either end. Its true size is hard to comprehend, even once you get inside.

This giant airship factory with a floor space equivalent to eight American football fields (364,000 sq ft or 34 000 sq m) was the vision of two men, Paul W Litchfield, and Dr Karl Arnstein. The former was the first CEO of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, who spearheaded its tie-up with the German Zeppelin Company to build airships. The latter became one of the most important airship designers in the 20th Century thanks to his work for Goodyear.  

Litchfield had the vision. He built the Airdock because he wanted to construct a new generation of huge, state-of-the-art helium-filled rigid American airships for long-distance commercial passenger flights, and to position Goodyear as the world's leading manufacturer of passenger-carrying airships. Rigid airships are given their shape by the complex metal framework needed to support a huge envelope filled with enough hydrogen or helium to lift a sizeable number of passengers, or cargo, for days at a time. The contracts he signed with the US Navy to build the USS Akron and USS Macon, the world’s first flying aircraft carriers and two of the largest aircraft ever flown, would subsidise the research and development needed for these passenger craft.

This wasn't as mad it seemed. In the 1920s the future of long-distance aviation seemed to be the airship. In 1919 the British R-34 had flown across the Atlantic and back. In 1928 the Graf Zeppelin made its first transatlantic demonstration flight from Germany to Lakehurst, New Jersey; a regular commercial service to Brazil soon followed.

Civil servants in London drew up plans to unite the British Empire through a fleet of giant airships. Goodyear joined the race too, setting up its own companies to identify routes across the Atlantic and Pacific.

"Litchfield was worried that the British were going to beat him to this global airship service, and he watched what they did very closely," says John J Geoghegan, journalist and author of the book When Giants Ruled the Sky. "He knew that once they opened up a route to Canada, that North America wasn't going to be far behind."
